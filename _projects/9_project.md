# Smart car system based on visual and electromagnetic navigation (Winner of National First Prize)
## Introduction
NXP Cup, an autonomous car competition, is designed to provide students real-world experience with autonomous vehicles. We designed two cars with electromagnetic sensors, cameras, speed encoders, ultrasonic sensors, laser sensors, gyro accelerometers to finish the closed circuit. The track is white, the background is blue, and there is a alternating current line in the middle of the track. There are complex elements in the track such as: intersections, roundabouts, s-curves etc.
## About NXP Cup
This project is from College Student Smart Car Competition sponsored by NXP. I have participated in this competition with two teammates twice, each season lasted for eight months.
## Result
We are the Winner of National First Prize (top 0.5%, 10/2000)!
