# Lab‑on‑an‑App: AI Empowered Point‑of‑Care Diagnostics for Ageing Population (PhD project funded by EPSRC, UK)
An overview of the project is shown in the figure below the text.
## Background
Anemia is a significant global health issue that affects a substantial portion of the population, including young children, pregnant women, and the elderly. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that approximately 42% of children under five, 40% of pregnant women, and 20% of older adults worldwide suffer from anemia.

Typically, anemia manifests as general weakness or fatigue, diminished concentration, and shortness of breath during physical activity. In severe cases, symptoms may include palpitations, angina (especially if there is pre-existing heart disease), intermittent claudication, and signs of heart failure.
## Problem
Anaemia, defined as reduced hemoglobin concentration. Diagnostic thresholds are set at less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL) for men and less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL) for women. Traditional diagnosis method for anemia requires laboratory-based measurements of a venous blood sample  which faces challenges like high cost, producing medical waste, invasive and inflexible location.
## Soluation
To address the existing issues in anemia diagnosis, we propose to design a multimodal AI  model with integrated hardware accessories on the smart phone to combine electronic health records (EHR), biological images, and non-invasive sensor signals to achieve pain-free, portable, and accurate diagnosis. The  system is named as 'lab on an APP' whose main mission is to provide  personalized prediction, personalized treatment planning and personalized monitoring for users. 
## Key challenges

### Algorithmic level
* Ensuring robustness of multimodal learning despite potential modality missing or noise interference.
* Handling medical time series with missing values and  irregular time intervals.
* Developing an effective multimodal fusion framework that can integrate EHR data, biological images, and sensor data efficiently.

### Hardware level
* Highly integration of sensors, power supplies, microprocessors and communication modules.
* Designing a multi-wavelength PPG system.
* Achieving low power consumption while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio.

### Trial level
* Obtaining ethical approval and recruiting participants for trials.
* Designing effective trial processes and incorporating feedback mechanisms.
* Navigating product iterations and market transformation efficiently.
